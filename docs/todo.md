# Todo

- [ ] Send another message, because clearly the looming deadline isn't enough of a hint
- [ ] Crash the voice channel and unleash a tirade if they dare to game before submitting their problem
- [ ] Implement a slash command to add users, because clicking a few buttons is just too much work
- [ ] Create a slash command to send reminders manually, because automated reminders are so mainstream
- [ ] Text message, because we all know how much everyone loves getting more of those
